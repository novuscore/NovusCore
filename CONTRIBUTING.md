# Contributing with NovusCore

Awesome! You want to help and contribute to NovusCore!

You can contribute in different ways for NovusCore, either by opening bug reports, suggesting fixes for already open issues, proposing fixes 
with Pull Requests (PR) or by suggesting new ideas.

## What should I know before I start?

1. First off, NovusCore has 3 projects which you can contribute to:

Our [World of Warcraft 3.3.5 Branch](https://github.com/novuscore/NovusCore)

Our [NovusCore-GMClient](https://github.com/novuscore/NovusCore-GMClient)

Our [NovusCore-Client](https://github.com/novuscore/NovusCore-Client)

Make sure you choose the correct project to contribute to.

2. Do not open an issue or PR to ask a question, you will get a quicker response in our [Discord Channels](https://discordapp.com/invite/W8XTFJ?utm_source=Discord%20Widget&utm_medium=Connect).

## Opening a Bug Report üìù

1. First thing you should do is to make a quick search to see if the same or a similar issue is already opened.
If so, just add your information to that report. It saves us a lot of time if we don't have to close duplicate reports.

2. Always make sure you are running the latest revision of the core and database. If you are running something old chances are that your
bug might already be fixed in the newer revisions.

3. Never post more than **one** bug per issue report. For example; Quest A should have 1 report and Quest B should have another report unless
they are directly related to each other. (Same goes for Creatures/Raids/Dungeons/Etc.)

4. Never post a copy paste of a crash log in an issue.
Use a service like [Github Gist](https://gist.github.com/) to paste your crash log and then link it in the issue with a description.

**Your title should always be after what the issue is about. For example "Quest: The Denouncement" or "Creature: The Lich King"**

**Your issue should always contain information on How it is Working, How it should Work and the revision you are having on your core/DB.**

When you are creating an issue make sure you are following the issue templates, that is important so we can get a report that is clean
and easy to understand. (issue templates are not made yet).

If you have a fix to your issue please open the issue and then a PR containing the SQL/C++ fix you have so that others can
review and add onto it. If you do not have a fix for your bug, then just open an issue.

If you are linking SQL data in your report please use a code box with SQL format.

## Opening a PR üìùüíª

A Pull Request should always have an opened issue that it refers to.

When opening a PR you should:
1. Fork NovusCore.
2. Create a new Branch.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Push your changes to your branch.
5. Open a PR.

You should also always follow the Pull Request Template when opening a PR, that is important so we can get a PR that is clean
and easy to understand. (Pull Request Template is not made yet).

Before a Pull Request is merged it will go through a couple of checks to makes sure the fix works and is compatible.
- The PR will be built by the CI's.
- The PR will be reviewed and approved by someone else on NovusCore to make sure everything is looking okay.
- The PR will need to be tested in-game to see if it actually a valid fix.

## Feature Requests

All Feature Requests should be opened as an issue with the template for Feature Requests.

If there is a fix for the feature request you can go ahead and open a pull request for it, however, feature requests are only merged if they
are deemed to be necessary and useful.

## Additional information

We of course appreaciate all contributions you do, small or big. It helps us noticing issues faster and being able to fix them in a good
pace.
